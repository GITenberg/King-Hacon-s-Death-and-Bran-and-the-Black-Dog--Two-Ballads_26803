5</span>KING HACON&rsquo;S DEATH</h2>
<p>And now has happened in our day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What was in ancient time foretold:<br />
Beneath his hand all Norroway&rsquo;s land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has Hacon brought, the wise and bold.</p>
<p>Full many a warrior summons he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From all the country far and near;<br />
To Scotland&rsquo;s realm, with shield and helm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the sea the King will steer.</p>
<p>As many as sword and helm can bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With him must sail across the foam;<br />
All of fit age must follow their liege,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who are not may tarry at home.</p>
<p>It was Hacon, Norroway&rsquo;s King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Survey&rsquo;d the gallant band with pride:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m missing one&mdash;my Andfindson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O where does Olaf the stripling bide?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Then answer&rsquo;d him the little footboy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not far that stood from the Monarch&rsquo;s knee:<br
/>
&ldquo;Olaf, my Lord, will come on board<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as weigh&rsquo;d the anchors be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out they stood from Bergen town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And out from Bergen&rsquo;s mole, I trow;<br />
Silk is the sail they spread in the gale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Painted with blue is the deck below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Magnus hear, my son so dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At home I tell thee thou must stay:<br />
Aarhus to ward and Bergen to guard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the keys of Norroway&rsquo;s land are
they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen all dearest father mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall thy word I entreat of thee;<br />
To rule rough earls and Norroway churls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too ignorant far and too young I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then clothe thee straight and clothe thee well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since thou wilt follow me, my child:<br />
But much I fear thou can&rsquo;st not bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The toss of the sea and its billows wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>So out they stood from Bergen town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &rsquo;twas at fall of evening grey;<br />
The folk on the shore they griev&rsquo;d full sore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As that brave armament sail&rsquo;d away.</p>
<p>And when they came to Lindeness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mounting billow the sail bespray&rsquo;d,<br
/>
In the breeze so fair the ship stood there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As though to the bottom it fast were made.</p>
<p>Then said the King as he lean&rsquo;d upon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His trusty faulchion&rsquo;s hilt of gold:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here in the dark, is there any clerk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or layman here can this thing unfold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out spoke Nilaus Noderness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As a glance he flung upon the deep:<br />
&ldquo;Doom&rsquo;d men on board, have we my Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth from thee I cannot keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was our Norroway Hacon then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereat so sorely troubled grew:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m missing one, my Andfindson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why meets not Olaf his father&rsquo;s
view?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Then answer&rsquo;d him the little footboy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As apart he stood from the Norway King:<br />
&ldquo;Beneath the deck lies Olaf sick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And much I fear he&rsquo;s suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Hacon the Norway King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To visit Olaf with speed he goes:<br />
&ldquo;What cheer, what cheer, my Olaf dear?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy state to thy father straight
disclose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel no rest within my breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Methinks my very heart will rend:<br />
Would God, the King of all, would bring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This horrible night to a speedy end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched o&rsquo;er Olaf Andfindson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They watched o&rsquo;er Olaf long nights twain;<br
/>
And Hacon I say, of Norroway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By watching thus his death did gain.</p>
<p>It was Olaf Andfindson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He yielded up his gentle sprite;<br />
&rsquo;Twas Hacon grey of Norroway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before him held the big wax light.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>O then King Hacon distrest he grew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stripling&rsquo;s corse he would not leave:<br
/>
He pin&rsquo;d away and sick he lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His hoary Counsellors how they grieve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; they said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
fought and bled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And almost won these foreign shores;<br />
But if thou now from us should&rsquo;st go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sad and dreary fate were ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My time is come, I can&rsquo;t survive;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Write ye my testament, I pray,<br />
When I am gone do ye see done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What with my dying breath I say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, King Magnus, I advise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever the law of God to heed;<br />
Justice above all things to love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well, full well, with him &rsquo;twill
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priests and widows let him defend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his reign, I trow, will not be brief;<br />
The outlaw crew let him pursue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hang unpitying every thief.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;These are the first things I request,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll crave another thing;<br />
Ye&rsquo;ll bury me with my ancestry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In our Lady&rsquo;s Church as beseems your
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Bergen&rsquo;s shore came tidings o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which made the hearts of the dauntless faint:<br />
&ldquo;Hacon is dead, our regal head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Relation near to Olaf Saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Orkney isle expir&rsquo;d the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a Thursday morning that befell;<br />
&rsquo;Twas Pentecost when the King they lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mighty King whom they lov&rsquo;d so well.</p>
<p>From high Kirkwall now sail&rsquo;d they all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to Bergen o&rsquo;er their course they ply;<br
/>
They laid in grave the Monarch brave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the spot where the Monarch wish&rsquo;d to
lie.</p>
<p>A braver heart ne&rsquo;er play&rsquo;d a part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never shone in Minstrel&rsquo;s lay;<br />
No King on earth can vie in worth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Hacon the Good of Norroway.</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG</h2>
<p>The day we went to the hills to chase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of dogs we had a brave company;<br />
There heard we the songs of the feather&rsquo;d race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blare of the elk, and the roebuck&rsquo;s
cry.</p>
<p>In the hills we had no common sport,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With our dogs and our arms many deer we slew;<br />
When at noon we return&rsquo;d to our silvan court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We were a well-pleas&rsquo;d, laughing crew.</p>
<p>That night the house of the Fenian king<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a band of joyous guests was fill&rsquo;d;<br />
The manner we sang, whilst we plied the string,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which the buck and the elk we kill&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The valiant Finn arose next day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the sun rose above the foam;<br />
And he beheld up the Lairgo way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A man clad in red with a black dog come.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>I&rsquo;ll tell ye what was the stranger&rsquo;s
mien:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His complexion was that of the strawberrie;<br />
White as the canach was his skin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though black his hair, as black could be.</p>
<p>He came up with a lofty gait,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said not for shelter he sought our doors;<br />
And wanted neither drink nor meat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But would match his dog &rsquo;gainst the best of
ours.</p>
<p>We brought &rsquo;gainst that of the stranger youth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very best dogs within our bounds;<br />
But the stranger dog had a desperate tooth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quickly despatch&rsquo;d for us fifty
hounds.</p>
<p>A strange fight this, the great Finn said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he turn&rsquo;d his face towards his clan;<br />
Then his face with rage grey fiery red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he struck with his fist his good dog Bran.</p>
<p>Bran look&rsquo;d at his master with much surprise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That his master should strike him surprise he
felt&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I could hew from the shoulder the hand,&rdquo; Finn
cries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;With which my dog that blow I
dealt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Then Bran he shook his collar of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountains echoed with his bay;<br />
His terrible eyes like fire-balls roll&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his mind was bent upon canine fray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off from his neck the collar of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not right for him now such a thing to bear;<br />
And a free good fight we shall behold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Betwixt my dog and his black compeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now a likeness I&rsquo;ll draw of my good dog Bran:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His head was cover&rsquo;d with shaggy hair,<br />
His breast was broad and its colour tan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His houghs were crook&rsquo;d, his quarters
square.</p>
<p>Four yellow feet had he I ween,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His sides were black but his belly fair;<br />
A tinge of green on his back was seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of blood-red ears he&rsquo;d a pointed pair.</p>
<p>The dogs their noses together placed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then their blood was scatter&rsquo;d on every
side;<br />
Desperate the fight, and the fight did last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Till the brave black dog in Bran&rsquo;s
gripe died.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;O sure was I,&rdquo; did Ossian cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the pillar of the dogs with stern delight,<br
/>
&ldquo;There was no dog in the Finn country<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could inflict upon Bran the mortal bite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Bran was a stag-hound Morong bred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And possess&rsquo;d each canine guile and
sleight;<br />
There was no dog in leash e&rsquo;er led<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could consign our dog to the Western height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a damsel, heavenly bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With azure eye and yellow hair,<br />
In the land of the son of King Torc this night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be proud with my dog her supper to
share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grave the valiant hero made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his good black dog in the field&rsquo;s green
breast;<br />
Full fifty dogs the Fenians laid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the pibroch&rsquo;s blast in the hill to the
west.</p>
<p>We went to the dwelling of high MacCuol,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the king to drink, and dice, and throw;<br />
The king was joyous, his hall was full,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though empty and dark this night I trow.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
